ChatGPT - Introduction

0. Debugging - Python Factorial
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.
Fix the code, it should print the factorial of the argument.

1. Debugging - Python Arguments
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.
Fix the code, it should print only the arguments without the python file name.

2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.
Fix the code, it should change the background color when you click on the button.

3. Debugging - Python Mines
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

Game Overview: Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden “mines” without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

Fix the code, implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, thus winning the game.

4. Documentation - Python Factorial
mandatory
Objective: Use ChatGPT to document the code
Add the comments to this code. You should have 3 sections: function description, parameters and returns.

5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook
Objective: Use ChatGPT to document the code
Fix the code, to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), add error handling mechanisms.

6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples. (There may be several errors on the code)

Game Overview: Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
Warning: Test all the user inputs !
